# The galabeam pack

### Sidenote (don't worry about this if you've never seen this pack before)
People wanted my resource pack because it made the <i>en_us.json</i> informal.<br>
Now this pack lives here!

### Why this may be interesting to you!
This adds a number of changes to the game visually without ultimately making the game different.<br>
This makes all UI elements purple, which is the main attribute of this pack besides the swords.<br>
Full list of changes below.

### What does this pack actually change?
Changes <i>credits.json</i>, just because you can.<br>
Makes <i>end.txt</i> person ยง3 a lot more Generation-Z-like whilst person ยง2 says the same things.<br>
Changes <i>splashes.txt</i> to things such as my favourite bands being better and random words.<br>
<b>Informal <i>en_us.json</i></b><br>
Realistic textures based on the recipe. (ex. sword)<br>
Changes the panorama to a hued grass block.<br>
All UI elements have been "purplized" as I call it.<br>
Rextures some particles and paintings.<br>
Makes clouds have the classic <i>fluff.png</i> texture.<br>
Tones down the pumpkin blur.<br>
Changes the totem to a model of my old Minecraft skin.<br>
Changes main menu, "JAVA EDITION" to say, "GALABEAM PACK".

### Planned features
Interesting retextures that still look like vanilla. (I'll explain them when I figure out what they actually will be)<br>
Maybe some extra things, I don kno.<br>

### <b>Words of importance</b>
I only release versions of the pack based on the versions I play on.<br>
I'm not going to test the pack on other versions but it will probably still work as long as it doesn't say it's outdated(because of the pack_format variable).

# The main highlight of this all
